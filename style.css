/* 
- I do not need to use media queries if the flexbox is used
- flexbox is the easiest way for positioning of the elements
- rem, vh, vw should be easier to use instead of pixels and makes the things responsive more easier, too
- height on body was changed to min-height with 100vh so it can grow 
- width on card was changed to max-width and rem were used
- wodth of the image was changed to max-width because the max-width on the card will stopi it if needed
- height was removed on the card completely because it will be dictated automatically by the browser
